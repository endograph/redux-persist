# Redux Persist Migration Example

`persistReducer` has a general purpose "migrate" config which will be called after getting stored state but before actually reconciling with the reducer. It can be any function which takes state as an argument and returns a promise to return a new state object.

Redux Persist ships with `createMigrate`, which helps create a synchronous migration for moving from any version of stored state to the current state version.

### Example with createMigrate
```js
import { createMigrate, persistReducer, persistStore } from 'redux-persist'
import storage from 'redux-persist/es/storage'

const migrations = {
  0: (state) => {
    // migration clear out device state
    return {
      ...state,
      device: undefined   
    }
  },
  1: (state) => {
    // migration to keep only device state
    return {
      device: state.device
    }
  }
}

const persistConfig = {
  key: 'primary',
  version: 1,
  storage,
  migrate: createMigrate(migrations, { debug: false }),
}

const finalReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, reducer)

export default function configureStore() {
  let store = createStore(finalReducer)
  let persistor = persistStore(store)
  return { store, persistor }
}
```

### Alternative
The migrate method can be any function with which returns a promise of new state. 
```js
const persistConfig = {
  key: 'primary',
  version: 1,
  storage,
  migrate: (state) => {
    console.log('Migration Running!')
    return Promise.resolve(state)
  }
}

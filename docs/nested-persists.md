# Nested Persists
Nested persist can be useful for including different storage adapters, code splitting, or deep filtering. For example while blacklist and whitelist only work one level deep, but we can use a nested persist to blacklist a deeper value:
```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { persistReducer } from 'redux-persist'
import storage from 'redux-persist/lib/storage'

import { authReducer, otherReducer } from './reducers'

const rootPersistConfig = {
  key: 'root',
  storage: storage,
  blacklist: ['auth']
}

const authPersistConfig = {
  key: 'auth',
  storage: storage,
  blacklist: ['somethingTemporary']
}

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  auth: persistReducer(authPersistConfig, authReducer),
  other: otherReducer,
})

export default persistReducer(rootPersistConfig, rootReducer)
```

The root config blacklists `auth` because the nested `persistReducer` already saves `auth` under its own key. If the root saved it too, `auth` would be stored twice, and the root copy would include `somethingTemporary`, the field the nested config is meant to exclude.
